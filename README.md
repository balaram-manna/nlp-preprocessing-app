# NLP Preprocessing Streamlit App

## 📖 Project Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an essential field of Artificial Intelligence used for understanding and processing human language.  
This project is a **web-based NLP preprocessing application** built using **Streamlit** that allows users to apply common text preprocessing techniques interactively.

The app helps in preparing raw text data for Machine Learning and Deep Learning models by applying standard NLP preprocessing steps.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
To build an NLP preprocessing tool that can clean and transform raw text data into a machine-readable format using techniques such as:

- Tokenization  
- Text Cleaning  
- Stemming  
- Lemmatization  
- Bag of Words (BoW)
